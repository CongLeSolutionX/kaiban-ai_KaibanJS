### Setting Up the Development Environment

Before you start contributing, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking, clone your fork of the KaibanJS repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaiban-ai/KaibanJS.git
   cd KaibanJS
   ```

3. **Install Main Dependencies**: In the root directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Playground Dependencies**: Navigate to the playground/react folder and install its dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd playground/react
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**: In the playground/react directory, create a `.env.local` file and add the necessary API keys for the examples you plan to run:

   ```bash
   cd playground/react
   touch .env.local
   ```

   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   VITE_MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
   ```

   Going back to the root directory, run:

   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```

   Note: You only need to add the API keys for the services you'll be using in your examples.

6. **Compile the Library**: In the root directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Launch Storybook Playground**: Open another terminal window To open the Storybook playground, run:
   ```bash
   npm run play:sb
   ```

   This will start a local server and open your browser to the Storybook playground.

Now you're ready to start developing!
