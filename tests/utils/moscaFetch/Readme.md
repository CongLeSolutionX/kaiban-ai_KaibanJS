# MoscaFetch Utility

## Introduction

`moscaFetch` is a testing utility designed to simplify the process of mocking and recording HTTP requests in Node.js environments. It provides an easy-to-use API for setting up mocks and capturing actual request-response cycles for use in tests.

## Features

- **Mock HTTP Requests**: Simulate HTTP responses without making actual network calls.
- **Record Requests**: Capture and log HTTP requests and responses to refine tests or mock setups.
- **Callbacks**: Execute custom logic after a mocked request is handled.
- **Restore**: Cleanly revert any modifications to the global fetch, maintaining test isolation.


### Usage

#### Importing

```js
const { mock, record, restoreAll, getRecords } = require('moscaFetch');
```

#### Mocking Requests

To mock HTTP requests:

```js
mock({
    url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
    method: 'POST',
    body: '*',
    response: { key: 'value' },
    callback: info => console.log('Request completed', info)
});
```

Or use wildcard * to mock all Request

```js
mock({
    url: '*',
    method: '*',
    response: '*',
    callback: info => console.log('Request completed', info)
});
```

Configuration Options

- `url`: URL to match the request (string or wildcard `*`).
- `method`: HTTP method to match (string or wildcard `*`).
- `expectedBody`: Expected body to match for incoming requests (object or wildcard `*`).
- `response`: Response to return when a request is matched.
- `callback`: Function to execute after a request is handled.


#### Recording Requests 

To record requests for later analysis or setup:
```js
// Setting up recording
record({
    url: '*',
    method: '*',
    body: '*'  // Record any POST request to this URL
});

// After your requests
const recordedData = getRecords();
debugger;
console.log(recordedData); 
// Then Copy/Paste the object from the console
```

#### Retrieving Records

To retrieve and log the recorded requests:

```js
const records = getRecords();
console.log(records);
```

#### Restoring Fetch

To restore the original fetch after tests:

```js
restoreAll();
```
