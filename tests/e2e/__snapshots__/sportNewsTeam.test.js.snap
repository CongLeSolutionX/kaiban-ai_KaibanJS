      "result": "Argentina Triumphs in Tumultuous Copa América Final

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

        "result": "Argentina Triumphs in Tumultuous Copa América Final

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

Argentina claimed victory in a dramatic and controversial 2024 Copa América final, edging out Colombia 1-0 in extra time after a match marred by significant delays.  The hard-fought win, secured by Lautaro Martínez's 112th-minute goal, cemented Argentina's dominance in South American football, despite a turbulent journey to the title.

The match, held at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, was overshadowed by significant crowd trouble outside the venue.  Eighty precious minutes were lost due to security concerns and the need to restore order before the game could safely resume.  This unprecedented delay added a layer of tension to an already high-stakes encounter, testing the players' endurance and nerves.  The atmosphere inside the stadium, while enthusiastic, was undoubtedly impacted by the events unfolding outside.

Lionel Messi, despite being crucial to Argentina's success throughout the tournament, suffered an injury during the match and was forced to leave the field prematurely.  This injury added to the sense of uncertainty surrounding the outcome and further elevated the importance of Martínez's game-winning goal.  Martínez's performance throughout the tournament was exceptional, earning him the top scorer award with an impressive five goals.  His decisive strike in the extra time period ultimately secured the championship for Argentina.

Argentina's victory in the 2024 Copa América is a testament to the team's resilience and ability to overcome adversity.  While the match was overshadowed by external factors, Argentina's triumph remains a powerful symbol of their unwavering commitment and exceptional skill.  The game will be remembered not only for the thrilling victory but also for the remarkable challenges faced and overcome, leaving a lasting impression on the history of the Copa América.",

The game proved to be fiercely contested, as Colombia sought to dethrone the defending champions.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{

   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

other

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

Your role is: Information Gatherer.
Your background is: Research.
Your main goal is: Find up-to-date information about the given sports query.
You are working as part of a team.

For your work you will have available:

- Access to a defined set of tools. 
- Findings and insights from previous tasks. You must use this information to complete your current task.
- Must follow a specific format for your output.

## Tools available for your use: 

tavily_search_results_json: A search engine optimized for comprehensive, accurate, and trusted results. Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. Input should be a search query. Tool Input Schema: {"type":"object","properties":{"input":{"type":"string"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"}

**Important:** You ONLY have access to the tools above, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here.

## Format of your output

You will return just one of the following:

- Thought + (Action or Self Question)
OR
- Observation
OR
- Final Answer

Below is the explanation of each one:

### Thought + (Action or Self Question)

{
   "thought": "your thoughts about what to do next", // it could be an action or ask yourself a follow up question
   "action":  "you decide what action to take based on your previous thought", // the action could be a self follow up question or decide to use a tool from the available tools to use,
   "actionInput": the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \\" to wrap keys and values. Remember to use the Tool Schema.
}

Examples: 

{
   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "tavily_search_results_json",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

   "thought": "To find out who won the Copa America in 2024, I need to search for the most recent and relevant information.",
   "action": "self_question",
   "actionInput": {"query":"Copa America 2024 winner"}
}

### Observation

{
   "observation":  "Reflect about the result of the action. (E.g:  I got the following results from the tool Can I get the Final Answer from there?)", 
    "isFinalAnswerReady": false // If you have the final answer or not
}

### Final Answer

IMPORTANT: (Please respect the expected output requirements from the user): Detailed information about the sports event. Key players, key moments, final score and other usefull information.

{
    "finalAnswer": "The final answer to the Task."
}

**IMPORTANT**: You must return a valid JSON object. As if you were returning a JSON object from a function.

This goal not only sealed the win but also emphasized the sheer determination and skill that has characterized Argentina's journey throughout this tournament.
