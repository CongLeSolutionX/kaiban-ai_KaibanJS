```js

// Define agents with specific roles and goals
const profileAnalyst = new Agent({
    name: 'Mary', 
    role: 'Profile Analyst', 
    goal: 'Extract structured information from conversational user input.', 
    background: 'Data Processor',
    tools: []  // Tools are omitted for now
});

const resumeWriter = new Agent({
    name: 'Alex Mercer', 
    role: 'Resume Writer', 
    goal: `Craft compelling, well-structured resumes 
    that effectively showcase job seekers qualifications and achievements.`,
    background: `Extensive experience in recruiting, 
    copywriting, and human resources, enabling 
    effective resume design that stands out to employers.`,
    tools: []
});

// Define the tasks for each agent
const processingTask = new Task({ 
  description: `Extract relevant details such as name, 
  experience, skills, and job history from the user's 'aboutMe' input. 
  aboutMe: {aboutMe}`,
  expectedOutput: 'Structured data ready to be used for a resume creation.', 
  agent: profileAnalyst
});

const resumeCreationTask = new Task({ 
    description: `Utilize the structured data to create 
    a detailed and attractive resume. 
    Enrich the resume content by inferring additional details from the provided information.
    Include sections such as a personal summary, detailed work experience, skills, and educational background.`,
    expectedOutput: `A professionally formatted resume in markdown format, 
    ready for submission to potential employers.`, 
    agent: resumeWriter 
});

// Create and start the team
const team = new Team({
  name: "Resume Creation Team",
  agents: [profileAnalyst, resumeWriter],
  tasks: [processingTask, resumeCreationTask],
  inputs: { aboutMe: `My name is David Llaca. 
    JavaScript Developer for 5 years. 
    I worked for three years at Disney, 
    where I developed user interfaces for their primary landing pages
     using React, NextJS, and Redux. Before Disney, 
     I was a Junior Front-End Developer at American Airlines, 
     where I worked with Vue and Tailwind. 
     I earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from FIU in 2018, 
     and I completed a JavaScript bootcamp that same year.` },  // Initial input for the first task
    env: {OPENAI_API_KEY: 'your-open-ai-api-key'}  // Environment variables for the team
});

// Listen to the workflow status changes
// team.onWorkflowStatusChange((status) => {
//   console.log("Workflow status:", status);
// });

team.start()
  .then((output) => {
    console.log("Workflow status:", output.status);
    console.log("Result:", output.result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Workflow encountered an error:", error);
  });
```

## Basic Concepts

**Agents** 
Agents are autonomous entities designed to perform specific roles and achieve goals based on the tasks assigned to them. They are like super-powered LLMs that can execute tasks in a loop until they arrive at the final answer.

**Tasks**
Tasks define the specific actions each agent must take, their expected outputs, and mark critical outputs as deliverables if they are the final products.

**Team**
The Team coordinates the agents and their tasks. It starts with an initial input and manages the flow of information between tasks.

## Key Features

<!-- - **Role-Based Agent Design:** Design agents with specific roles and goals.
- **Redux-Inspired Architecture:** This architecture offers a unified approach to managing the states of all AI agents. As a big plus, it integrates effortlessly into your React applications.
- **Real-Time Visualizer:** Built-in UI visualizer for development and debugging.
- **Browser and Server Compatibility:** Works seamlessly across client and server environments.

```js
import { Agent } from "kaibanjs";

const daveLoper = new Agent({
  name: 'Dave Loper',
  role: 'Developer',
  goal: 'Write and review code',
  background: 'Experienced in JavaScript, React, and Node.js'
});

const ella = new Agent({
  name: 'Ella',
  role: 'Product Manager',
  goal: 'Define product vision and manage roadmap',
  background: 'Skilled in market analysis and product strategy'
});

const quinn = new Agent({
  name: 'Quinn',

<details style="margin-bottom:10px;">
  <summary><b style="color:black;">Tool Integration</b></summary>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">
Just as professionals use specific tools to excel in their tasks, enable your AI agents to utilize tools like search engines, calculators, and more to perform specialized tasks with greater precision and efficiency.

In this example, one of the AI agents, Peter Atlas, leverages the Tavily Search Results tool to enhance his ability to select the best cities for travel. This tool allows Peter to analyze travel data considering weather, prices, and seasonality, ensuring the most suitable recommendations.
</p>

```js
import { Agent, Tool } from "kaibanjs";

const tavilySearchResults = new Tool({
  name: "Tavily Search Results",
  maxResults: 1,
  apiKey: "ENV_TRAVILY_API_KEY",
});

const peterAtlas = new Agent({
  name: 'Peter Atlas',
  role: 'City Selector',
  goal: 'Choose the best city based on comprehensive travel data',
  background: 'Experienced in geographical data analysis and travel trends',
  tools: [tavilySearchResults]
});
```

  const useTeamStore = myAgentsTeam.useStore();

  const { agents, workflowResult } = useTeamStore(state => ({
    agents: state.agents,
    workflowResult: state.workflowResult,
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={myAgentsTeam.start}>Start Team Workflow</button>
      <p>Workflow Result: {workflowResult}</p>
      <div>
        <h2>🕵️‍♂️ Agents</h2>
        {agents.map(agent => (
          <p key={agent.id}>{agent.name} - {agent.role} - Status: ({agent.status})</p>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default KaibanJSComponent;
```
