# Issue and PR Labels Guide

This document outlines the labels used in our GitHub repository to manage issues and pull requests. Labels help categorize and prioritize tasks, making it easier for contributors and maintainers to find and address them.

## Label Categories

### Type

- `bug`: Indicates an issue that represents a bug in the project.
- `feature`: A request for new functionality.
- `documentation`: Issues or PRs that solely relate to documentation improvements or corrections.
- `enhancement`: Suggestions that improve existing features.
- `question`: Used when a contributor has a question about the project.

### Priority

- `critical`: Issues or PRs that must be addressed immediately to resolve a severe impact on the project.
- `high`: Important issues that affect the project significantly but are not immediately damaging.
- `medium`: Issues that have a noticeable impact on the project but aren't urgent.
- `low`: Minor issues that are considered low impact.

### Status

- `help wanted`: Indicates that the maintainers seek external help to address the issue or implement the feature.
- `good first issue`: Ideal for newcomers to the project.
- `in progress`: Work has already begun on this issue or PR.
- `on hold`: Issues or PRs that are not currently active but are planned for review later.

### Resolution

- `wontfix`: The issue will not be addressed.
- `duplicate`: Indicates that the issue is already reported or resolved in another issue or PR.
- `invalid`: The issue is not relevant or is no longer applicable.

### Project Components

- `landing-page`: Issues specifically related to the development and improvements of the project's landing page.
- `library`: Issues and enhancements directly related to the codebase of the library component of the project.
- `playground`: Pertains to the interactive examples or sandbox environments that allow for testing or playing with the project's features.

## Using Labels

When creating or triaging issues and PRs, use the appropriate labels to categorize and prioritize them. This helps maintainers quickly identify the type and urgency of the tasks, and facilitates better project management.

- Combine labels from different categories to provide detailed context (e.g., `bug`, `high` for a high-priority bug).
- Use the `question` label to indicate that further discussion or clarification is needed on an issue.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for ensuring that issues and PRs are correctly labeled and that the labeling system is updated as the project evolves. Regular audits of labels should be conducted to retire or update labels as necessary.

## Contributors

Contributors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with these labels to better understand the development workflow and to participate effectively in the project.

## Feedback

Feedback on the use of labels and suggestions for new labels are always welcome. Please submit any proposals for new labels or changes to existing labels as issues in this repository.
