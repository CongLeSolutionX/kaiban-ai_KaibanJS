User Registration: The specification outlines a seamless process for existing users to invite new users through email, with unique referral links for tracking and reward allocation.\n2. Referral Tracking: The system will maintain clear records of referrals, tied to individual user accounts, with real-time status updates and rejection reasons when applicable.\n3. Rewards Management: A well-defined reward system for both referrer and referee is established, with automatic application upon successful referral and clear indication of reward validity.\n4. Referral Program Settings: The administrative interface allows for easy configuration of referral program settings, including reward amounts, referral limits, and periods, along with enabling/disabling the referral program as needed.\n5. Notifications and Communications: Notifications will be sent at various stages of the referral process, with customizable email templates available for fine-tuning.\n6. Reporting and Analytics: The system will provide essential performance metrics, such as the number of referrals, conversion rates, and revenue generated from referrals, with filtering and export capabilities.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements: Security, user data protection, performance optimization, modular architecture, user-friendly interface, and cross-browser compatibility have been addressed in the specification.\n\nPlease find attached the validated technical specifications document in Markdown format, ready for development.
