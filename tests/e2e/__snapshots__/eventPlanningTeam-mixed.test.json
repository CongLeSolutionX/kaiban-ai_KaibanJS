The rationale for choosing this date is that it aligns with better availability for key stakeholders and ensures that there are no major public holidays or events that could conflict with attendance. Additionally, this date falls within a relatively open period for venues. However, potential considerations include monitoring for inclement weather, as June can bring unpredictable conditions, and confirming final availability with stakeholders closer to the date.",
